# Steel & Scale Character Builder

## Description

Steel & Scale is a complete and comprehensive Tabletop Role-Playing Game, based on a d20 system, designed to be simple for new players to pick up, with enough complexity to provide variety and tactical depth for experienced TTRPG players. With no fixed classes, and vast options for customisation, no two characters will be the same! Based on the work of Sam Barker available at: https://steelandscale.com/

To assist with character building process, this project has been created. With the goal to streamline the steps required to make complete and robust characters without retracting from the customization available in the Steel & Scale system.
